Hello there! I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer, as thirsty for knowledge as a hummingbird is for nectar (a bit of the biologist in me). My coding journey, spanning over a year, has been nothing short of exhilarating and packed with all sorts of emotions.

With over 8 years of experience in Biotechnology and a background in Customer Service and hospitality, I've honed my communication and problem-solving skills. 

On the lookout for a Junior Full Stack Developer role where I can bring my energy and skills to a vibrant team.
